    "* If validation accuracy drops while training accuracy rises, you’re overfitting.\n",

    "##### 3. Use Early Stopping\n",
    "* Instead of fixing 50 epochs, train with a maximum (like 50) but stop automatically when validation loss stops improving for several epochs.\n",
    "* This prevents wasting time and avoids overfitting.\n",
